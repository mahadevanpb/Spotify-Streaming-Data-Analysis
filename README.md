# Spotify-Streaming-Data-Analysis
 This project analyzes a user's Spotify streaming history to derive insights into their listening behavior. The following key analyses were performed:

Top Artists by Playtime: A grouped bar chart visualizing the top 10 most-listened-to artists, comparing total playtime between the years 2023 and 2024.

Top Songs by Playtime and Skips: A dual-axis plot that compares the total playtime of the top 10 songs with the number of times they were skipped, helping to identify which popular tracks are also the most replayed.

Listening Activity by Hour: A bar chart that visualizes listening activity across the 24 hours of the day. The chart is ordered to show the listening cycle from evening to morning (18:00 to 17:00), highlighting peak listening hours.
